# Classificiation
Image Classsification using SVM

# Image Segmentation

Image classification is a supervised learning problem: define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos.

## Features

- Reads the image.csv and edgehistogram.csv files containing image labels and feature vectors respectively from user.
- Performs image classification using algorithm : Support Vector machine

## Tech
Script uses following tech stack:

- [Python] - An interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.

## Installation

Clustering Algorithm requires [Python](https://www.python.org) 3+ to run.

- Scripts used : Image_Classification_SVM.ipynb
- Place the scripts into a directory of choice.
- Navigate to the directory and run the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
or 

```
pip install the modules mentioned in the requirements.txt file

```
## Usage

- Navigate to the folder where the script is placed.
- Run the script "Image_Classification_SVM.ipynb" . Provide the images per class if any particular number of images per class is required in the function "load_data()"
